# stream_list

### cad 
* paint turret
* DIY cad kernel (at least a sketch solver)
* 3d reconstruction of printed geometry 
* generative design
    * there are many instances where there are only a few driving parameters for a design-example: DC switching power supply etc. the question is: given a list of specifications can the form factor, circuit, etc be generated? 
* 500 sub special. write names of all public subs with the CNC. need to figure out how to do a timelapse triggered by homing or switches (can I do it with GRBL board?)

### textiles

* make apple skin glow and eat it
* make skin glow 
* glowing tatoos
* optical circuits. modulate tissue properties like viscosity 
* induce pluripotency 
* grow a dense array of Merkel cells and use an electrode array to encode. then make the world's best touch sensor. like 1000s of times better than our fingers 
* build an OTTO liquid handler
* make a solution of lipids under a microscope and demonstrate primitive vesicle division and formation 
* culture some random stuff and do pcr and electrophoresis 
* model LUCA 
* download a ton of genomes, iteratively refine them to figure out which genes are the most conserved DIY phylogenetics
* does alphafold have a ribosome world model implicitly learned? basically an AI molecular dynamics project
* economics of vegan gelatin bioreactor
* long term ($20k) openIDS2 https://github.com/regiregire/OpenIDS2 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53944-x
* diy 3d printed microtome and at home microscope slide prep. ultrasonics? peltier on device?

### bend
* diy interaction combinators 
* matmul how fast is linear algebra 
* cellular automata
* graph viz, what do the graphs look like?
* nn inference 
* lean pf of ic turing completeness?
* proof of confluence 
* ski combinators? what do the resulting graphs look like?

### lean 
* basic euclidean geometry - is_rectangular_cuboid
* prove Playfair's axiom
* continue with Mathematics in Lean series 
* prove that it takes 6 cuts to square a block - or figure out how to show the minimal necesary constraints required in each cut to square the block 

### misc
* enzyme rust mnist 
* ai evals - o1 
* apis for analytics
* stretchy pcbs https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844
* mnist in 15 different ways / languages 
* diy twitch that allows user composition of sources 
* finish basic hypergraph rewriting in rust
* cnc kitchen 3d print tester. load cell device https://github.com/CNCKitchen/Open-Pull 
* series going through "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" 
* cnc etch a sketch
* obviously a robotic arm 
* silicone mold (flower holder) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RooDSCfF5_U 
* a basic program that lets me use a midi controller like a drum rack to play clips of video then a basic timeline to render it out.
* spotify playlist lyrics search
* a google earth tour of the silicon supply chain
* plate techtonics modeling, mineral maps. deep sea mining and ocean acidification
* legal precedence graph. gather up all court cases and extract dependency information and build a graph
* open source genius clone but fully embrace the collective media. not just music but all books videos etc. 
* download a bunch of mr beast videos and look at the audio and basic statistics on how loud voices are 
* rpi thing that detects fire with low error and triggers a fire extinguisher
* what if you could pay/invest in the ability to recommend videos to people (algorithmically) and based on viewer retention and basically ad dropoff engagement would get a cut of ad revenue? basically decentralizes Google's YouTube algorithm since it's atrocious 
* diy dynamicland https://youtu.be/5Q9r-AEzRMA why Bret Victor didn't open source it I have no idea
* human head joystick
* liquid crystal tunable filter and acusto optical tunable filter 

### process and av
* transcribe all my videos (just with yt-dlp) ,make them searchable notebook lm/rag thing? 
    - retrieve timestamp and maybe be able to quickly pull up the link at the correct timestamp 
    - everynight or something it resyncs to a git repo so its always up to date 
    - https://github.com/anandijain/video_transcripts
* streambot
    * eventually will be openobsbot, but for now a raspberry pi with obs in an enclosure with a super simple touchscreen to start streaming or have an assistant.
* cute recording light that turns on when im live
* make a small script that quickly copies and renders the footage from the go pros using ffmpeg 
* "how to make a build montage" - go over mark rober, stuffmadehere, etc to see what they do 
* make a "for tha summer" style edit
* roaming stream/driving stream https://www.starlink.com/us/roam 
* I built the ULTIMATE outdoor workbench, follows sunlight power, and it's HUGE. Omni wheels, can raise up and down, auto leveler 

### cas3 
* merge jupyter pr  
* Function/lambda calculus
* basic OutputForm 

### one day builds
* array of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-V1uXeyGmg 
    * would be cool to make waterproof, have it point at the garage and put a qr code to the streams making it.
    * what happens if you point a projector at the mirror section?
