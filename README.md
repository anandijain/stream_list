# stream_list

### cad 
* paint turret
* DIY cad kernel
* 3d reconstruction of printed geometry 
* generative design
    * there are many instances where there are only a few driving parameters for a design-example: DC switching power supply etc. the question is: given a list of specifications can the form factor, circuit, etc be generated? 

### textiles
* computer design of flexible materials / cad to support / designing a tent
* diy tufting robot
* manufacturing 100+ triangular canvases of different sides to make a large tufted scultpure 

### chemistry 
* finally do symbolic rewriting of molecules (basically graph pattern objects) - copy mathematica https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTgg88jy5w8

### bio 
* hardware building a home lab
* make cells glow
* make apple skin glow and eat it
* make skin glow 
* glowing tatoos
* optical circuits. modulate tissue properties
* induce pluripotency 

### bend
* diy interaction combinators 
* matmul how fast is linear algebra 
* cellular automata
* graph viz, what do the graphs look like?
* nn inference 
* lean pf of ic turing completeness?
* proof of confluence 
* ski combinators? what do the resulting graphs look like?

### lean 
* basic euclidean geometry - is_rectangular_cuboid
* prove Playfair's axiom
* continue with Mathematics in Lean series 

### misc
* enzyme rust mnist 
* ai evals - o1 
* apis for analytics
* stretchy pcbs https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844
* mnist in 15 different ways / languages 
* diy twitch that allows user composition of sources 
* finish basic hypergraph rewriting in rust
* cnc kitchen 3d print tester. load cell device https://github.com/CNCKitchen/Open-Pull 
* series going through "Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos" 
* cnc etch a sketch
* obviously a robotic arm 


### process and av
* transcribe all my videos (just with yt-dlp) ,make them searchable notebook lm/rag thing? 
    - retrieve timestamp and maybe be able to quickly pull up the link at the correct timestamp 
    - everynight or something it resyncs to a git repo so its always up to date 
    - https://github.com/anandijain/video_transcripts
* streambot
    * eventually will be openobsbot, but for now a raspberry pi with obs in an enclosure with a super simple touchscreen to start streaming or have an assistant.
* cute recording light that turns on when im live
* make a small script that quickly copies and renders the footage from the go pros using ffmpeg 
* "how to make a build montage" - go over mark rober, stuffmadehere, etc to see what they do 
* make a "for tha summer" style edit

### cas3 
* merge jupyter pr  
* Function/lambda calculus
* basic OutputForm 

### one day builds
* double pendulum desktop toy (608 bearings, 3d print)
* array of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-V1uXeyGmg 
    * would be cool to make waterproof, have it point at the garage and put a qr code to the streams making it.
    * what happens if you point a projector at the mirror section?
* chaotic magnet toy. attach encoders and drive one with a motor. have it make music 
    * https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kftVqA0UVDY
    * https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4pF9QDVZmQY
* big inflated rolling lighting. make a large 3d printed base 


### done
